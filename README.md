But the type of problem to be solved, the notion of what algorithms are "efficient, and even the model of computation can vary widely from area to area. In this second class in algorithms, we will survey many of the techniques that apply broadly in the design of efficient algorithms, and study their application in a wide range of application domains and computational models. The goal is for the class to be broad rather than deep. Our plan is to touch upon the following areas. This is a tentative list of topics that might be covered in the class; we will select material adaptively based on the background, interests, and rate of progress of the students.

We will learn about these advances in this course. A theme will be combinatorial constructions with random-like properties, e.g., expander graphs and error-correcting codes. Some examples:

- [CS 6118 Types and Semantics - Cornell University](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/CS6118/2012fa/)
  - **University Courses**, **Programming**
  - *Cornell University*
  - Types and Semantics is about designing and understand programming languages, whether they be domain specific or general purpose. The goal of this class is to provide a variety of tools for designing custom (programming) languages for whatever task is at hand. Part of that will be a variety of insights on how languages work along with experiences from working with academics and industry on creating new languages such as Ceylon and Kotlin. The class focuses on types and semantics and the interplay between them. This means category theory and constructive type theory (e.g. Coq and richer variations) are ancillary topics of the class. The class also covers unconventional semantic domains such as classical linear type theory in order to both break students from conventional thinking and to provide powerful targets capable of formalizing thinks like networking protocols, resource-sensitive computation, and concurrency constructs. The class project is to design and formalize a (programming) language for a purpose of the students choosing, and assignments are designed to ensure students have had a chance to practice applying the techniques learned in class before culminating these skills in the class project.
